# hobby-website

For this project, I created a personal hobby project centred around one of my interests. The project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout the development process, I utilised a range of techniques to ensure that the project was engaging, user-friendly, and visually appealing.

**PLANNING:** 

- The main objective of this project was to showcase my personal hobby using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project also included specific requirements such as incorporating images, a link, and header and footer elements. 

- Having clear guidelines and requirements for the project allowed me to effectively plan and structure the website. Using these guidelines as a starting point, I was able to brainstorm and ideate on how I wanted the layout and design of the website to look and feel. Once I had a clear vision for the project, I began to implement this vision.

**BUILDING:**

- When building my hobby project, I began by creating a simple navigation menu with two items: "Home" and "Blog." As requested, I also added the current date and positioned that in the navigation bar.

- To display the current date on the webpage, I created a function that uses the Date() method to set the inner HTML of an element with an ID of current-date. Then, I initialised a new Date object to extract the current day, month, and year and concatenated them into a string formatted as day-month-year.

- After implementing the navigation bar, I proceeded to the main part of my webpage where I discuss my hobby, share a recipe, and provide a link to a tutorial video on how to make vanilla cupcakes. For this section, I utilised CSS flexbox to achieve a layout where the text is positioned on the left side while the image is aligned on the right side of the page. This layout provides a clear separation of content and adds visual interest to the page.

- To create the recipe section, I utilised tools such as lists to organise the information provided. In addition to the recipe, I added a button that directs users to a YouTube page to follow a tutorial for the recipe I shared. After finishing the main content of the web page, I proceeded to add a footer before applying any CSS styling

- To make sure that the web page could be easily viewed and navigated on various devices, I implemented CSS media queries. By defining different styles for different screen sizes, I was able to ensure that the layout and content were optimised 
To make the web page responsive I added css media queries to ensure the web page is user friendly and can be used on different screen sizes.

 **DEBUGGING:**
 
- During the development of the recipe section, I noticed that the button that directed users to the YouTube tutorial was not functioning properly. When inspecting the code, I discovered that the link was pointing to an incorrect URL. To fix this issue, I updated the link with the correct URL and tested it on different browsers to ensure it worked properly.
