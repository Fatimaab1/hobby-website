            <h2 class="title">Baked with Love: From My Kitchen to Yours
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">From a young age, baking has been a passion of mine. I can still remember the
                excitement
                I felt as a child when I was allowed to help my mother in the kitchen, cracking eggs or measuring
                ingredients. As I grew older, I started to experiment with baking on my own, and I quickly fell in love
                with the process.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Baking has always been a way for me to channel my creativity and express myself
                in a
                way that feels both satisfying and rewarding. There's something truly special about the way that baking
                brings people together, and the memories I've created over the years in the kitchen with my loved ones
                are some of my most cherished.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                One of my favourite recipes to share is a vanilla cupcake recipe. These cupcakes are light and
                fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness. They're the perfect blank canvas for any frosting or
                toppings you'd like to add.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Ingredients:</h4>

            <ul class="recipe">
                <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
